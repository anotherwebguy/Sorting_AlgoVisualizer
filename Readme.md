# Sorting Algorithms Visualization
Sorting lgorithm Visualizer is an interactive web platform that visualizes algorithms from code. since learning algorithm gets much easier with visualizing it.

## Algorithms Supported:
  1. <h2><b>Bubble Sort:</b></h2> Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
  2. <h2><b>Selection Sort:</b></h2> The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.
  3. <h2><b>Insertion Sort:</b></h2> In Insertion sort, the array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
  4. <h2><b>Merge Sort:</b></h2> In Merge Sort, the array is initially divided into two equal halves and then they are combined in a sorted manner.
  5. <h2><b>Quick Sort:</b></h2> Quick Sort picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. The target of partitions is, given an array and an element x of an array as the pivot, put x at its correct position in a sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller than x) before x, and put all greater elements (greater than x) after x.
  6. <h2><b>Heap Sort:</b></h2> Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to selection sort where we first find the minimum element and place the minimum element at the beginning.
